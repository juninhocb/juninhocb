### Hi, I'm Carlos Eduardo Junior. 👋 

## 👨🏻‍🎓 About Me

###### 🔭 I started my journey (2014) focusing on calculus, statistics, algebra, physics, ordinary and transformed differential equations and mathematical modeling, which I consider essential for my base. Throughout my college education, I focused on computational systems, taking all optional subjects in the area, during this period, I sought to understand the fundamentals of computing, understand the hardware components and especially the operating systems and how they are constituted. My start in programming started when I was young in HTML markup language (2010), in college I had the pleasure of starting my studies in C language (2015), which I consider my foundation for any programming learning. Throughout my initial programming learning period, I focused on learning C, C++, Matlab, Ladder and Assembly, along with the study of microcontrollers, microprocessors and operating systems. Recently (2019), I have entered the world of object-oriented programming, increasingly seeking to understand patterns between languages and the fundamentals that compose them. I've been participating in academic projects since (2015), the most notable being: Simucar - whose function is to read data from a car through the OBD2 protocol and display them through a WEB application in real time; SmartStorage - whose purpose is to read the tag with computer vision tools and translate them into data provided by an android application and processed by software. Professionally developing solutions for companies since 2020 and working effectively as a programmer since 2022. Focus: mobile development, where I've been doing projects since 2020. My focus in this modality is with Flutter technology. Java(2019) and Services with Spring Boot (2022).

###### 👨🏻‍🔧 I professionally developed a Smart Home skill for Alexa, which you can find in the Amazon store. <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Circuitec-Alimentador-Inteligente-VeryPet/dp/B0BF5XM84Y/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=C6NLQ8QKJCCZ&keywords=verypet&qid=1663243954&s=alexa-skills&sprefix=very%2Calexa-skills%2C367&sr=1-1">Alimentador Inteligente</a>
