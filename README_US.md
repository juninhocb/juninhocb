### Hi, I'm Carlos Eduardo Junior. 👋 

## 👨🏻‍🎓 About Me

###### 🔭 I started my journey with a focus on studies of calculus, statistics, algebra, physics, ordinary differential equations, transforms and mathematical modeling, which I consider essential for my base. Throughout my college education, I focused on computer systems, taking all elective courses in the area, during this period, I sought to understand the fundamentals of computing, understand the hardware components and especially the operating systems and how it is constituted. My beginnings in programming started when I was young in HTML markup language, in college I had the pleasure of starting my studies in C language, which I consider my foundation for any programming learning, throughout my period of learning in initial programming, I focused on learn C, C++, Matlab, Ladder and Assembly, along with the study of microcontrollers, microprocessors and operating systems. Recently, I have entered the world of object-oriented programming, increasingly seeking to understand patterns between languages ​​and the foundations that compose them.

###### 👨🏻‍🔧 I professionally developed a Smart Home skill for Alexa, which you can find in the Amazon store. <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Circuitec-Alimentador-Inteligente-VeryPet/dp/B0BF5XM84Y/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=C6NLQ8QKJCCZ&keywords=verypet&qid=1663243954&s=alexa-skills&sprefix=very%2Calexa-skills%2C367&sr=1-1">Alimentador Inteligente</a>
